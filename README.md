## SIREN: Semantic, Initialization-Free Registration of Multi-Robot Gaussian Splatting Maps

SIREN enables robust registration (i.e., fusion) of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting maps,
with no access to camera poses, images, and inter-map relative poses, via semantics-grounded
optimization centered on feature-rich regions of each map.
